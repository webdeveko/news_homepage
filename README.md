## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - React styles
- [Vite js](https://vitejs.dev/) 

### What I learned

With this project, i learn using map function in the navbar. i also practice the useEffect to make a mobile navbar.

Really fun project on how to make different layout from desktop view to mobile view.

### Continued development

I will continue to practice more about css layout using tailwind and get the project finish faster within my expected timeline.
